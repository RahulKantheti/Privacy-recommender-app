1. Permission Handling: Ensure that the application correctly requests permissions from the user based on the platform it's running on. Test scenarios where permissions are granted, denied, and revoked during runtime to verify the application's response in each case.
2. BLE Scan Initiation: Verify that the BLE scanning process starts correctly when initiated by the application. Test scenarios where scanning is triggered manually or automatically under different conditions.
3. BLE Scan Interruption: Confirm that the BLE scanning process stops when required, such as when the desired number of devices is found or when the user navigates away from the scanning screen. Test scenarios where scanning is intentionally stopped and ensure that resources are properly released.
4. Device Detection: Test whether the application accurately detects BLE devices within range during the scanning process. Verify that each detected device is correctly identified and included in the list of available devices.
5. Unique Device Identification: Ensure that each detected device is uniquely identified by the application, either through its MAC address or other distinguishing characteristics. Test scenarios where multiple devices with similar characteristics are present to avoid confusion.
6. Device RSSI Measurement: Verify that the application correctly measures the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of detected devices. Test scenarios where devices are at varying distances to assess the accuracy of RSSI readings.
7. Threshold Validation: Test whether the application stops scanning after a predetermined number of devices are found, as specified by a threshold. Confirm that scanning halts when the desired number of devices is reached to conserve resources.
8. Rescan Interval: Confirm that the application initiates rescanning after a specific time interval to update the list of detected devices. Test scenarios where new devices enter or leave the vicinity during the interval to ensure timely updates.
9. Server Communication: Verify that the application correctly formats and sends data to the server containing information about detected devices. Test scenarios where data transmission occurs over different network conditions.
10. Response Handling: Ensure that the application handles server responses appropriately, including successful responses, errors, and timeouts. Test scenarios where the server responds with different HTTP status codes or unexpected data formats.
11. Error Handling - Permission Denied: Test how the application responds when the user denies requested permissions, such as location access or Bluetooth scanning. Verify that the application provides informative messages and gracefully handles the situation.
12. Error Handling - Server Unreachable: Confirm the application's behavior when it cannot establish a connection with the server due to network issues or server downtime. Test scenarios where the device is offline or the server address is incorrect.
13. Error Handling - Invalid Server Response: Test how the application handles unexpected or malformed responses from the server. Verify that the application gracefully handles parsing errors or unexpected data structures.
14. Performance - Scanning Speed: Measure the time taken by the application to detect BLE devices within range. Test scenarios where the number of devices and environmental conditions vary to assess scanning performance under different circumstances.
15. Performance - Data Transmission: Assess the time taken by the application to send data to the server after detection. Test scenarios where the size of data payload and network conditions vary to evaluate transmission performance.
16. Edge Cases - No BLE Devices: Test how the application behaves when no BLE devices are detected during scanning. Verify that the application provides appropriate feedback to the user and handles the absence of devices gracefully.
17. Edge Cases - Empty RSSI Values: Confirm the application's behavior when RSSI values for detected devices are not available or empty. Test scenarios where devices are out of range or their signals are weak to assess handling of such situations.
18. Edge Cases - Permission Revoked: Test how the application responds when the user revokes previously granted permissions during runtime. Verify that the application gracefully handles the loss of permissions without crashing or malfunctioning.
19. Boundary Testing - Maximum Devices: Verify the application's behavior when the maximum number of devices specified in the design is detected during scanning. Test scenarios where the scanning threshold is reached to ensure proper handling.
20. Boundary Testing - Minimum Devices: Confirm how the application behaves when only a single device is detected during scanning. Test scenarios where only one device is present in the vicinity to assess the application's response.
21. Security - Data Encryption: Assess whether the data sent from the application to the server is encrypted to protect sensitive information. Test scenarios where network traffic is intercepted to verify data security measures.
22. Security - Permission Scope: Ensure that the application requests only the necessary permissions required for BLE scanning and data transmission. Test scenarios where excessive permissions are denied by the user to maintain privacy and security.
23. Usability - User Interface: Evaluate the clarity and intuitiveness of the user interface during the scanning process. Test scenarios where users initiate scanning and interact with scanning-related elements to ensure a smooth user experience.
24. Usability - Error Messages: Assess the effectiveness of error messages displayed by the application during various error conditions. Test scenarios where permissions are denied, server communication fails, or other unexpected errors occur to evaluate the clarity and helpfulness of error messages.
25. Compatibility - Platform Variations: Test the application on different platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) to ensure compatibility and consistent behavior across devices. Verify that platform-specific features and behaviors are properly handled.
26. Compatibility - Device Variations: Confirm that the application performs reliably across different devices with varying hardware specifications and capabilities. Test scenarios on devices with different Bluetooth capabilities, screen sizes, and processing power to identify any device-specific issues.
27. Localization - Permission Messages: Verify that permission request messages displayed by the application are correctly localized based on the user's language preferences. Test scenarios where the device's language settings are changed to assess localization support.
