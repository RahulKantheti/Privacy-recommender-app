## Design and architecture

The project, "Privacy-related behavior recommendation for IoT sensors in our daily life," integrates front-end and back-end components to offer personalized privacy suggestions. The front-end mobile application, built with Expo React-Native, ensures simplified development and cross-platform compatibility, enhancing accessibility and efficiency. Users can authenticate and access sensor information and mitigation strategies through an intuitive interface. Utilizing sensors in IoT devices, the application dynamically adjusts recommendations based on user location and available sensors, improving relevance.

On the back end, Django powers data analysis and recommendation generation, leveraging stability, security, and scalability. It receives data from beacons, determines user location through triangulation, and retrieves nearby active devices to assess privacy hazards. Seamless communication between front-end and back-end components enables immediate and pertinent assistance to users in navigating privacy risks. The architecture prioritizes user-centricity, aiming to raise awareness of privacy risks in the IoT era through personalized recommendations and user-friendly interfaces.
